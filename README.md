# UI-Polyglot


## Goal
The goal is to :
1. know the ide
2. know the language syntax and idioms - best practices
3. create a simple app with data fetching
4. being able to install new libs
5. being able to build/deploy a bundled version

## Blueprint
Here's the blueprint :

Create an app with two screens (with routing between them)
- screen 1 : homepage with a button to go to next page
- screen 2 : single page with a button to fetch some data from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and display a list of results when the data is received + display a notification saying ‘Data retrieved !’ and store data in DB (SQLITE or IndexedDB or Realm or whatever type of persistence layer)
